This is my first attempt at a feedforward dense neural network to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST data set. 

It's not very optimized in it's current state, but with a low enough learning rate and enough epochs you can get very high accuracy.

I intend to implent Save/Load model functionality, and expariment with diffent activation, loss, and weigh initialization functions.
